# ZK Proof of Learning - Aptos Smart Contract

## Project Description

The ZK Proof of Learning is a revolutionary smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables **privacy-preserving educational credential verification**. This system allows learners to prove they have completed educational courses without revealing the actual content of their learning materials or assessment answers.

### How It Works

- **Instructors** create courses with cryptographic proof requirements (expected hash values)
- **Learners** submit zero-knowledge proofs of completion without exposing their learning content
- **Smart Contract** verifies completion while maintaining complete privacy of the learning process
- **Blockchain** provides immutable, verifiable credentials that can be trusted by third parties

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Privacy-First**: Learning content remains completely private  
‚úÖ **Trustless Verification**: No need for centralized authorities  
‚úÖ **Immutable Records**: Blockchain-based credential storage  
‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures one completion per learner per course  
‚úÖ **Transparent Statistics**: Public completion counts without compromising privacy  

## Project Vision

Our vision is to **democratize education verification** by creating a decentralized, privacy-preserving credentialing system that:

- **Eliminates Educational Fraud**: Provides cryptographic proof of genuine learning
- **Protects Student Privacy**: Keeps learning content and assessment responses private
- **Enables Global Recognition**: Creates universally verifiable credentials across institutions
- **Reduces Verification Costs**: Eliminates expensive third-party credential verification services
- **Empowers Self-Directed Learning**: Allows anyone to prove their knowledge regardless of institutional affiliation

### Core Principles

üîê **Privacy by Design**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure learning content never leaves the learner's control  
üåç **Universal Access**: Blockchain-based system accessible to anyone, anywhere  
‚ö° **Instant Verification**: Real-time credential verification without intermediaries  
üõ°Ô∏è **Tamper-Proof**: Immutable blockchain records prevent credential forgery  

## Future Scope
